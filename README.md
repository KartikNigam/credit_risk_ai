# AI-Powered Credit Risk Assessment

## üìå Project Overview  

This project leverages machine learning to assess credit risk, predicting whether a customer is at low risk or high risk of loan default based on financial and demographic factors. The model is deployed using Flask for API-based predictions and Streamlit for an interactive user interface, making risk evaluation seamless and efficient. üöÄ

üí° Key Takeaways:  
üîπ Applicants with stable employment, good credit history, property ownership, and manageable financial obligations are at lower risk.  
üîπ Factors like longer loan duration, poor savings, unstable job history, and higher installment burdens contribute to a high-risk profile.
